What about hardware hack? 

It would be cool to have hardware talk to google functions? 

Or is that necessary? Hardware should probably directly communicate with server. The server should communicate with 

take photos of an object with phone from many different angles, from this construct a 3D map, from this guess what the object is, 
from this generate an animation, from this display the 3D object in the browser with AR?

COVID COUNTER

GOAL ::: Tell you how many people in a picture likely have COVID? 

Static website that asks you to take a picture of the crowd and asks for your location. 
After providing both, output statistics and a highlighted photo. 

input: 
- photo of crowd
- location

intermediate steps
- ping covid data api to get an estimated density 
- ping google-cloud-function that takes in photo and returns helpful info

show statistics: 
- how many people are in this crowd? 
- how many people have covid? 
- how likely is it that nobody in the crowd has covid? 
- randomly highlight people in the crowd to show the "covid density"

PROBLEM: finding NN to count/locate heads
- found crowd counting paper (2020): 
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07538.pdf
- similar idea, seems easier to run (2019): 
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06473v1.pdf
- just doing face recognition in crowd? 
    - google api face detection
